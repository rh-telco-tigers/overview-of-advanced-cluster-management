This article is based on version 2.3.2 of ACM.  This article is somewhat dated (menus, etc) but the use-cases are still the same.

ACM provides the mechanism to create and manage Openshift clusters at scale.  In some cases, even non-Openshift clusters can be managed.

I am going to provide a walkthrough on some of the menus in the Multicluster hub object in ACM.  The multicluster hub (in simple terms) is the route that is exposed in Openshift for performing ACM functions.
